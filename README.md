# 📡 OpenRAN Gym-Based Anomaly Detection and Auto-Recovery System

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository presents a modular AI-driven framework for **anomaly detection** and **self-healing recovery logic** within a 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), using synthetic and simulated KPI data generated through [OpenRAN Gym](https://github.com/open-5g/openrangym). The project replicates a real-world telecom automation pipeline, incorporating RAN telemetry ingestion, unsupervised anomaly detection, and rule-based automated mitigation strategies — aligned with Open RAN and Self-Organizing Networks (SON) principles.

> ⚙️ This initiative was undertaken as part of a professional internship at Bharti Airtel Networks Division, with the goal of solving real-world telecom performance bottlenecks using cutting-edge, open-source RAN simulation environments.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Ingest and preprocess simulated RAN KPI datasets
- Normalize and clean multivendor/multiformat KPI logs
- Detect anomalous behavior using AI/ML models
- Simulate corrective recommendations (SON-inspired)
- Visualize network health in real time with a lightweight dashboard

## 📌 Motivation

Modern 5G networks are increasingly software-defined, data-rich, and complexity-driven. However, most AI/ML systems in telecom remain siloed in R&D. This project bridges the gap between **simulation** and **real-world field logic**, enabling future-ready telecom engineers to build, test, and demonstrate intelligent, scalable, and autonomous network solutions.

## ✨ Outcomes

- 🚀 Full-stack anomaly detection and auto-recovery demo using open tools
- 🧠 Practical ML for telecom KPIs in a SON-like loop
- 📊 Real-time visualization of network performance and health
- 💼 Portfolio-ready for careers in **network automation**, **AI Ops**, or **Open RAN R&D**
