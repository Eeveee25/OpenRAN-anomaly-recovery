NetSage: AI-Driven Telecom Cell Outage and Network Degradation Detection
Project Overview
This project presents an advanced machine learning framework designed for proactive detection and classification of cell outages and network degradations within telecom networks. By analyzing a rich set of network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), alarm logs, and traffic data, the system identifies anomalies affecting cell performance. Additionally, it proposes optimized recovery actions such as antenna tilting to maintain network reliability and service quality.

This solution aims to empower network operators with intelligent, automated monitoring tools to enhance operational efficiency and reduce service disruptions.

Objectives
Accurately detect cell outages in live telecom network environments using anomaly detection algorithms.

Classify diverse degradation types, including coverage loss, interference, hardware failures, and congestion-related issues.

Develop an adaptive antenna tilt compensation strategy that mitigates the negative impacts of detected outages and degradations.

Automate the entire detection and classification process leveraging machine learning techniques for scalable deployment.

Perform temporal pattern analysis to capture sequential KPI behaviors indicative of network health trends.

Conduct feature importance and KPI correlation analysis to understand the impact of various network metrics on performance degradation.
